# Bank-app
a quick little app that calculates saving including interest

#project summary
this project had me working on a banking app that calculate money increase through intrest and deposits or no deposits over a set amount of time.

#what i did well
i think for this project i did a good job at designing the display as i wanted it to be simplistic but appealing other than that i though overall i did a good job on the project.

#where could you enhance your code
overall i think i could enchance my code by getting better at writing loops as well as cleaning my code up as i have trouble with that sometimes and more inline comments during the process not after to help keep my train of thought.

#what pieces of code i found most challangeing
the hardest part for me in most projects is still loops i feel as though im getting better but it takes me a long tiem to get them to function properly and when and where to use for or while loops i overcame them by using extra resources and looking at similar project.

#what skill wil be transferable
most of everything i did will be transferable but mostly the better knowledge of loops will be the most helpful as im still learning them and how and when to use them properly and this helps.

#how did i make this program maintainable readable and adaptable
i think i did a good job with explaining in inline comments as well as proper spacing to make it readable as for maintainable it is a fairly simple project that could be adapted over time to calculate even more and you ncan jump in and see where to add stuf through my inline comments
